As a starting point for tackling data analysis problems, I often ask myself how would I have approached this problem in Excel, if even possible? This is what happens when you've spent the bulk of your career knee-deep in Excel and then you shift to more advanced data science tools like Python and R.

I love good reference books and one that I keep on my bookshelf is _Beyond Spreadsheets with R_, by Dr. Jonathan Carroll. I've read through a lot of beginner's guides to R and RStudio - If you come from a traditional financial modeling background, or you're a daily power user of Microsoft Excel, I highly recommend this book. It teaches you everything from data manipulation to summarizing and grouping data, to looping with the R `purrr` package.

In my opinion, Dr. Carroll lays out one of the easiest-to-follow and best introductions to vectorization and the benefits of the `purrr` package. As stated by Dr. Carroll in Chapter 8 (link below), with `purrr`, "you can think of just about everything as a series of functions to apply repeatedly to elements." In corporate finance and financial modeling terms, the `purrr` package is essentially your answer to super long, complicated, nested IF statements in Excel.
