Microsoft Excel pivot tables and Google Maps... Obvious differences here, but both are driven by split-apply-combine methodologies that visualize data sets.

If you want to learn how to make a pivot table "from scratch," or enhance your analytics capabilities beyond Excel, learn R (or Python) as a starting point. R is an analytics and graphics programming language that is free, fun, and an interactive way to learn the R basics is via swirl. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to help you get started!
