June was a wild but exciting month. I finished major projects for graduate school, I graduated, moved, and most recently went abroad on vacation to disconnect. Definitely a nice recharge for the soul!

Some neat things are on the horizon and I'm excited to release my next wave of Scatter Podcast episodes starting on July 8.

I recently discovered an amazing online learning platform to learn about synthesizers and I had to share it... This might not be your cup of tea but if you like music, you'll enjoy this. Analog and digital synthesizers have been personal passions of mine over the last 15-20 years. I've been using Ableton Live for music production and sequencing since the mid-2000s, and the company just released [Learning Synths](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/), an interactive website to teach you synth and sequencing basics. For anyone interested, check it out!

Insider tip: I used Ableton Live to make the intro music for Scatter Podcast.
