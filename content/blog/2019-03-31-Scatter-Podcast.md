I am really excited to announce that Scatter Podcast is finally live, available on most music and podcast streaming platforms!

The first four episodes include a podcast intro and three episodes with engaging guests from The Home Depot, Pacific Life, and NYC & Company.

I plan to release one episode weekly - Look out for upcoming interviews with data science reps from T-Mobile, Databricks, KPMG, Chegg, Technossus, Levi Strauss, Google, TensorIoT, and more! If you have questions, comments, or companies that you'd like to hear me interview, let me know.
