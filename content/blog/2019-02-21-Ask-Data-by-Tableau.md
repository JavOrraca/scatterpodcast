The latest Tableau upgrade has a native natural language processing capability called Ask Data. Very neat improvement and view into the future of Tableau.

Ask it a question in plain English ("What is the profit over time, by business line?") and Tableau "determines the most appropriate visualization to satisfy the userâ€™s intent." Super neat, and I'm excited to give the upgrade a spin!

On the surface, Ask Data seems gimmicky... But as a starting point for visualizations, or for near-instant data investigation during a meeting, this is an awesome feature.
