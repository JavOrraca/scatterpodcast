Things not to do with Linux, learned the hard way, as we approach the end of 2019...

Update Ubuntu 19.04 to 19.10 on dual-booted systems. Not sure exactly where things broke down for me, but as of right now, #Ubuntu seems inaccessible. Not too bummed about it as everything is backed up, but if you've recently had the same heartburn and found a solution, please send me a message!
