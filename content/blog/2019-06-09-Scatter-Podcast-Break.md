School got in the way wrapping up massive projects, reports, and final exams.

The last year has flown by and I'm graduating with a MS in Business Analytics from University of California, Irvine. This is a snapshot of my MSBA class... Smart, kind, and funny people from all over the world and now I get to call them friends. Congrats folks!
