I was excited to recently hear an interview with [Tim Lafferty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-lafferty/) (Georgia Tech alum!) on the Super Data Science Podcast discussing life as a data science consultant. Really practical tips here (even bought Kirill's book, [_Confident Data Skills_](https://confidentdataskills.com/) after the listen!).
