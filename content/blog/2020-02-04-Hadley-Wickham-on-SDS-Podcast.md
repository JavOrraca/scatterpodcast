My eyes were opened to the world of analytics and data science in part through Kirill Eremenko and his amazing SuperDataScience podcast.

Hands down, he was the inspiration for me starting my own podcast and I still listen to SDS weekly. Being a massive fan of RStudio, I'm super excited about this most recent SDS episode featuring Hadley Wickham, RStudio's Chief Data Scientist and creator of ggplot2, dplyr, author, professor... he's a research and data science genius!.

This episode is a great listen as he explores RStudio Python and R integration and the future of data science.
