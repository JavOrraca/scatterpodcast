Interested in an instructor led Python crash course? I'm a board member for UCI's [Merage Analytics Club](https://sites.uci.edu/merageaa/) and we're hosting a 1.5 hour Python for Business training led by my classmate and extremely talented programmer and data storyteller, [Samira Kumar Varadharajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirakumar/).

We'll be walking through Jupyter Notebook and providing an introduction to the following:
<br/>1. Basic Python libraries
<br/>2. Better visualizations in Python
<br/>3. Machine learning via Scikit-Learn

This event is open to all (students and non-students), is free for MSA members, and only costs 5 bucks for nonmembers.
