[Kirill Eremenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremenko/)'s Super Data Science podcast was the inspiration for Scatter Podcast, and I wouldn't have pivoted my career into this direction had it not been for his insights. His amazing team, including the talented [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadelin-de-ponteves-1425ba5b/), are contributing back to the data science community in meaningful ways and this conference is a steal for all that you get.
