Last year, I convinced 7 of my UC Irvine ("UCI") MSc in Business Analytics ("MSBA") graduate cohort to attend DSGO with me. It was an amazing conference and we were blown away by the presenters and breakout sessions. This year, it's super exciting to hear that roughly 60 students and faculty affiliated with UCI's 2020 MSBA class are attending DSGO. Equally exciting was hearing the news that UCI's MSBA program was the premiere educational sponsor for the event!

Representing UCI faculty and staff, [Bryan Mu√±oz, M.A.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmunozmo/) will be hosting a panel for executives on hiring and recruiting best practices for data scientists and analytics professionals, and [Professor Sanjeev Dewan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjeev-dewan-75302b17/) is speaking in the main room on 'Causal Influence in Customer and Social Analytics.'
