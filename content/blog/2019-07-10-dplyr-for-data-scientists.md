I have previously posted about the benefits of the dplyr package for data manipulation and performing if-else functions, but I wanted to share this R-bloggers post by Markus Berroth.

The post includes base R vs dplyr sample code to demonstrate how dplyr can make life easier for data scientists. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) illustrations are also super helpful for understanding what's happening with your R code.

These type of AST visuals are all over Hadley Wickham's _Advanced R (Second Edition)_, and they've definitely helped me to better understand my R code. My copy of Wickham's _Advanced R_ has already seen plenty of my handwritten notes... I love a good physical book to reference on my bookshelf... but rest assured, it's also available for free, in full, online!
