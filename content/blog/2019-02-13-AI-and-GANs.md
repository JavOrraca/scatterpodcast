I saw [Ben Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata/) present a few months back at DataScienceGO 2018 and was blown away by his overview of AI with respect to Generative Adversarial Networks.
<!--more-->
Ben is continuously researching and educating himself, pushing the limits of deep learning, and he's an advocate of side projects as a vehicle for growth (as am I!). Ben is super passionate about data science, harnessing computational power from GPU/CUDA systems, and his work with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is next level...

The image above is an AI-produced synthetic face made possible through GANs. Ben believes that continued innovation in GANs could allow us to predict DNA from a face, or vice versa, generating a face from DNA. I highly recommend you follow this reasonable futurist regardless of your discipline on LinkedIn or YouTube!
