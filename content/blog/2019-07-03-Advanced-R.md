I'm done with school but excited to continue learning! I picked up a copy of [Jonathan Regenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkregenstein/)s Reproducible Finance with R and [Hadley Wickham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadleywickham/)s 2nd edition of Advanced R.

For valuation professionals, financial modelers, and corporate finance professionals, I urge all of you to learn the R programming language. I assure you that you'll still use Excel (_often_), but from a reproducibility perspective for your complex recurring analyses and forecasts, R is a better solution for you. I'd be happy to provide some pointers, shoot me an email or reach me via LinkedIn.
