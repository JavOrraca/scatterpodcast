If you know me personally, you likely know that I enjoy playing with analog and digital synthesizers and enjoy producing electronic music. I love seeing my interests cross paths.

FactorSynth, a new virtual musical tool and Ableton Live plug-in, uses machine learning to decompose your audio clips into elements. These musical elements can then be modified and recombined in various ways (in real-time). Check out this demo reel (my words don't do this new device justice)!
