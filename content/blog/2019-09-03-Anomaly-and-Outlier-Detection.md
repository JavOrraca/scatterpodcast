For anomaly and outlier detection, the anomalize package for R, created by Matt Dancho, helped me identify outliers and smooth out my forecasting model while improving accuracy.

I used [Matt Dancho's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/) `anomalize` in conjunction with Facebook's `prophet` for a time-series projection. For R users out there: This package works beautifully with the tidyverse.

I'm continuously impressed by the stuff that Matt puts out including educational content, tutorials, webinars, and his package development. I followed one of his posts on Business Science to learn how to use his anomaly detection package.

FREE Learning Lab for Anomaly Detection:

* If you aren't aware of Matt Dancho's Learning Labs, every few weeks his company, Business Science, hosts educational webinars on a variety of topics. His next learning lab will cover the `anomalize` package to show you how to detect time series anomalies at scale to investigate 80 million rows + 150 groups of web traffic time-series data.
* Webinar Registration: [Learning Lab 18](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_H7lhu7GtQu6k5-cOpQgGUg)
