In mid-March, I worked with a team of UC Irvine students to analyze the Marvel Cinematic Universe and predict US box office revenues for Avengers Endgame.
<!--more-->
We estimated US box office revenues to be $639 million and as of today, domestic box office revenues are $645 million!

To my UC Irvine teammates (Ahnni, Daria, Joel, Xiaoting)... Great job! At the time that we developed our predictions, Captain Marvel had only been in theaters for one week... I just updated our models and our new domestic box office prediction for Endgame is $670 million. Congrats team!

_UPDATE (5/19/2019)_: As of today, US box office revenue has risen to $771 million.
