I just got _Hands-On Time Series Analysis with R_, by [Rami Krispin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rami-krispin/), and can't wait to crack it open! I have a knack for time-series analyses given most of the financial data and modeling I previously worked with was time-series based.

Had I known the full potential of advanced time-series forecasting techniques, I would have implemented some of these techniques _yesterday_! But as the saying goes, _and it's so cliche, but true_, "you don't know what you don't know."

Amazon has gotten crazy with their shipping... under no circumstances did I need this hard copy delivered in less than 24 hours, but glad to have it nonetheless! Congrats on your book, Rami! Excited to give your packages and methods a try.
