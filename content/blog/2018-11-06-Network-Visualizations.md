Network visualizations can be useful for understanding entity and large data interdependencies. I have been using R and the iGraph package to explore network analysis and found this tutorial to be an EXCELLENT one.

This tutorial was written by [Katherine Ognyanova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateno/) and I found it to be super helpful. It takes a lot of time to build these network graphs and more time to interpret, but definitely rewarding when it provides insights you may have otherwise overlooked. The screenshot above is a network diagram that I made to represent Amazon product copurchases.
