Two weeks ago, I knew nothing about the NFL despite my passion for futbol. I teamed up with my classmate and knowledgeable NFL fan, [Kaitlyn Drake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitdrake/), and developed a model and game simulation via R to predict the Super Bowl winner and final scores.

We predict that the Rams will barely win with a lead of 15 to 14. Itâ€™ll be a close game! We relied on Poisson regression, game simulation, and C4.5 / J48 decision tree to derive our results. Check the links out below for an overview of our presentation and GitHub repo where you can find the code and data sets utilized in our analysis.

This was my first public speaking opportunity on analytics and simulation modeling... Had a great time!
