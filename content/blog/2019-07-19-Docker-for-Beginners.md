Many of the developers and data scientists that I follow on LinkedIn have had extensive exposure to Docker for building and deploying apps via containers... I have not, but I have been thinking about this for months and finally got around to researching where to start.

I came across this IN-DEPTH(!!) and well-written Docker Tutorial for Beginners by [Prakhar Srivastav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakharsrivastav/).

Amazing stuff here, and exactly the kind of resource that I like to share. If you, like me, are familiar with the concept of containers but haven't yet dirtied your hands with something like Docker, I definitely recommend you check out this tutorial (or bookmark for later use).
