This is a great, 22-minute presentation by [Neil Sahota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilsahota/) at an AI conference. I met Sahota through UC Irvine, he recently taught my Technology & Analytics Consulting graduate course. In this video, Sahota discusses how AI can be used for social good and biodiversity.

Professor Sahota is a beast... In addition to recently publishing his first book on AI for business, he's extremely active in the data science community and contributes through mentorship and consulting, he's an IBM Master Inventor, he's the United Nations AI subject matter expert, and co-founder of the AI for Good initiative. Congrats, Professor Sahota! Keep up the momentum!
