Mathematics instructor turned data scientist, Juan Pablo is in customer analytics and works with engineering and analytics teams to improve the T-Mobile and MetroPCS customer experience. He has been a solid data science mentor for me over the last few months, reviewing, rating, and critiquing some of my R scripts and insights that I derived... Sharp guy and I'm excited to share his data analytics passion with others!
