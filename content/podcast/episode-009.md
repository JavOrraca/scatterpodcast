Built upon the Ethereum blockchain, RealBlocks allows accredited investors to buy into private equity real estate funds through the purchase of digital assets. RealBlocks went through #Techstars NYC's program (one of the top startup accelerators) and recently raised $3.1 million in seed funding in January 2019. Awesome stuff happening in NYC!
