Before "data science" became a catchphrase, Dr. Ballan was referred to as an algorithm developer.

At GM, Dr. Ballan's team aims to enhance the driver experience where she applies neuroscience theory to analyze massive data sets via machine learning and artificial intelligence. She provides great tips and resources for data science students and enthusiasts, and it's great to hear what she does on a day-to-day basis. Enjoy the show!
