David has worked with them for four years at the intersection of data science, transportation and urban planning, and he takes us through a deep dive into some of the work that he's done (providing career tips along the way!). David has spent significant time working with GIS systems, programming, and advanced visualizations, and he explains how these tools are helping to study and solve complex transportation planning challenges. Great feedback for aspiring data analysts and data scientists!
