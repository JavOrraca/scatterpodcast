Having spent several years at J.P. Morgan where he worked alongside quantitative analysts and researchers, Jonathan turned from Excel to R for more robust reporting, visualizations, and reproducibility of financial models. After joining RStudio, he continued to develop his R programming skills and eventually authored "Reproducible Finance with R - Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio Analysis."

We cover a lot popular packages, programming best practices, and upcoming tools that will enhance your modeling work flows. He offers a ton of valuable insights, be sure to follow him on LinkedIn and/or Twitter, and enjoy the show!
