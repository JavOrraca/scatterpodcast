Ryan, a Georgia Institute of Technology engineering and MBA alum, was a driving force for me diving into analytics and data science (thank you!). Ryan has been a great sounding board the past couple of years and he's a wealth of knowledge on analytics and digital strategies. He has great perspectives about being data-informed, and shares solid resources for careers in digital analytics. Enjoy the episode, and to stay connected with Ryan, signup for his email newsletter (I highly recommend it)!
