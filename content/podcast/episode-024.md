Christina has a BS in Science, Technology, and Society from North Carolina State University and holds a MS in Business Analytics and Big Data from IE Business School in Madrid. Having spent seven years in Spain and traveling frequently for business, workshops, and leisure, Christina shares a unique, international perspective on the state of data science and the tech world in 2019. At Google, she uses advanced analytics tools to drive insightful and actionable business impact for her clients to achieve their marketing goals. Christina is also a facilitator of Google's #IamRemarkable initiative to empower women and underrepresented groups to speak openly about their accomplishments in the workplace and beyond. For two years, Christina has also been an Adjunct Professor at IE Business School, teaching Big Data and Analytics-related courses for MBA students.

I really enjoyed getting to learn about Christina's work and she provides a lot of great resources to learn more about analytics and data science topics. We had an engaging discussion around diversity and inclusion in the tech world, and potential ways to tackle the inequality gap. Enjoy the show and feel free to reach out to Christina directly via LinkedIn!
