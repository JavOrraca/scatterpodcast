For [Episode 18 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-018), I interviewed [Leondra R. James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leondrajames/), Manager of Analytics and Operations at Saatchi + Saatchi.

Lots of neat things happening at the intersection of media, entertainment, analytics, and operations.

From violinist and music major to data scientist, Leondra has had a unique mix of academic and professional experiences that shaped her career in data. Saatchi & Saatchi is a global advertising agency operating in 76 countries and Leondra works in their Los Angeles office. She joined the agency in January 2019 but she's no stranger to media & entertainment having previously held data analytics roles at Alternative Revolt Magazine, Amazon Studios, and Twentieth Century Fox.

For creatives and non-technical people wanting to explore careers in data science, Leondra offers words of encouragement and provides feedback not often discussed in the data science community: "Your creativity is a strength that would benefit any data team!" Leondra drops lots of great tips and resources, so get ready to take some notes!

**Post-interview notes from Leondra:**
For you R users out there... Leondra shares some awesome packages to check out for business process analytics including bupaR and processmapR. Check out the links below. For general R and data science learning, I recommend the following resources which offer free-to-audit / affordable resources for learning: Coursera, Edx, SoloLearn, Code Academy, Khan Academy, Udacity, Kaggle, Future Learn, Lynda.com, DataCamp, Super Data Science, (and for cloud computing courses...) Google Cloud, AWS. The course I recommend for beginners looking to get a review on common algorithms and learning R / Python is Jose Portilla's Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamps on Udemy. He has one in Python and another in R. I would also recommend that people attend Meetups.
