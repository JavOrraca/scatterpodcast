On [Episode 22 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-022), I had an engaging interview with Will Chase, Data Scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.

I stumbled upon one of his interactive, web-based data visualizations (Visualizing Risk: Remotely Triggered Earthquakes) and I was fascinated by the way he leveraged the power of R, Mapbox, and D3 for his stunning data storytelling project.

Will has a BS in Microbiology and is almost entirely self-taught in the programming, data science, and advanced visualization space. He provides solid resources throughout the episode and lists some of his favorite, world-renowned data visualization designers (links also below). It's great to see Will contributing back to the data science community by open-sourcing most of his data visualization projects. Will is a great resource for anyone wanting to up the ante on their visualization skills and he's responsive via email, Twitter, and GitHub.

Definitely follow Will on your platform of choice... I have no doubt that he'll rise to be a visualization influencer in the years to come. If your organization is exploring data visualization designers for freelance work, contact Will to chat about your project requirements. After seeing more of his work, I'd highly recommend him. Enjoy the show!
